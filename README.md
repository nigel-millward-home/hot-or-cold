# Hot-or-Cold 
Hot or cold was an exercise from the Thinkful online front end development course. It was a bit of fun to illustrate how to use html, css and Javascript.

It was a while ago I did this. I think that html and css were provided, but the challenge was to write some logic with Javascript for the game. 

### Rules
What do I do?
This is a Hot or Cold Number Guessing Game. The game goes like this: 
				
1. I pick a random secret number between 1 to 100 and keep it hidden.
2. You need to guess until you can find the hidden secret number.
3. You will get feedback on how close ("hot") or far ("cold") your guess is.

### To run the code
Run the code using a webserver. Consider using MAMP for quick setup.
